🕵️‍♂️ CrimeSense - Crime Prediction Model
CrimeSense is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of crimes in a particular region based on historical data and patterns. This project aims to assist law enforcement agencies and concerned citizens in making informed decisions regarding crime-prone areas.

🚀 Features
📍 Location-based Crime Prediction

📊 Data Visualization for Crime Statistics

🧠 Machine Learning Model Trained on Real-World Datasets

🌐 Interactive Web Interface using Flask

📈 Accuracy and Model Performance Metrics

🧠 Model Details
Algorithm Used:  Random Forest 

Features Considered: Region, crime type, time, month, past crime history, etc.

Output: Crime probability score for a given location and time

🔧 Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Shubham-Kumar100/CrimeSense-Crime-prediction-model.git
cd CrimeSense-Crime-prediction-model
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

python app/app.py
Access the web app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is crime_data.csv, which contains anonymized historical crime data including:

Location/Region

Crime Type

Date/Time

Outcome

(Note: Replace with actual source if using a public dataset)


📌 Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time crime data from public APIs

Add geolocation-based alerts

Deploy on cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms (XGBoost, LSTM)
